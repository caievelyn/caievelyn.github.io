description: What is the effect of advertising on elections, and how can we refine our model to fit the data better than a linear regression?
---

The two goals of this week's blog post are as follow. Firstly, I would like to explore the mechanisms through which political advertising affects election outcomes and the implications for the 2020 election based off of partial advertising data. Next, I will construct a binomial logit probabilistic model and display the anticipated results of the 2020 election based off of 10,000 simulations using this binomial process.
