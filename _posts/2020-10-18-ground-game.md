description: What are the most salient factors to consider when predicting the 2020 election?
---

2020 is certainly an extraordinary year, and there are many new and existing factors that may contribute to the election outcome. While demographic voting blocs have always been of interest, prediction is complicated by issues in turnout and a damepened ground game due to COVID-19 restrictions. As such, this blog post will explore the ground game, voter turnout, and demographic variables to determine which factors are most salient for the 2020 presidential election.

## The Ground Game

In the past few elections, there has been a return to individualized voter mobilization efforts, known as the ground game. The mobilization effects of the ground game are proven and significant: In 2012, voter turnout increased 7-8% from the previous year in heavily targeted states ([Enos & Fowler, 2016](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/aggregate-effects-of-largescale-campaigns-on-voter-turnout/20C500B0DE62227873FD24CB3555F779/share/3d73ff531df62646698518c2717d3e1d33bcd0ef)). In fact, social scientists have even looked at the localized effects of field offices and projected that Obama's field office efforts raked in 275,000 additional voters in 2012, at a cost of $49.50 per vote when dividing the number of votes by the cost of operating said field offices ([Darr, 2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1532673X13500520)). However, in examining the 2016 election, the relationship between field office quantity and location and popular vote share is less clear:

While Clinton had a clear advantage in sheer number, various states that her campaign concentrated on still went red: Florida, Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. We also a see clear preference for both candidates to open up more offices in swing states, as solidly partisan states such as California and Texas saw few field offices.

I believe that including the ground game in this prediction is undesirable for two reasons: Firstly, there are still other factors that better explain the election in addition to field offices' locations, which don't immediately correlate with outcomes. Secondly, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ground game has been severely depressed. Because of differing levels of caution in regards to the risk of COVID-19 infection, the relationship between field office efforts and mobilization is further muddied. Even if certain door-to-door efforts are occuring, folks may not respond to a knock on the door in the middle of a pandemic. There are other avenues for the ground game to still be played: Through texting, phonebank campaigns, and snail mail. However, seeing as the strongest mobilization effects studied have been GOTV efforts and mobilization campaigns based out of field offices, rather than persuasion, I'd like to turn my attention to another part of the 2020 puzzle: demographic voting blocs.
