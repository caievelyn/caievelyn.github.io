# **About This Blog**

This blog is created as part of Gov1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard College led by Professor Ryan Enos. As we lead up to the November 2020 election, predicting the election is a matter of substantive importance to US citizens, foreign governments, and corporations worldwide. This blog seeks to explore and construct the best possible model to predict the 2020 presidential election.
